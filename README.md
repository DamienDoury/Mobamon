**Description:** Pokemon Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) based on League of Legends.

**The idea:**  Gather the fans of 2 famous franchises (Pokemon & League of Legends) in a MOBA game with a simplified gameplay to fit the youngest players skills.

**Challenges:** Creating the assets (3D models, animations, FX), developing a scalable and efficient networking system, learning Unity3D and Blender, adapting the gameplay from Pokemon to a real-time multiplayer game, managing a team of 11 software engineer students.
